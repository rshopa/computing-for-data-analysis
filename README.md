# Computing for Data Analysis

In this repository I will reveal my solutions to the problems from the practical part of "Computing for Data Analysis" online [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/ "Official site of Coursera") cousre. It uncovers the use of [R software environment](https://www.r-project.org/ "R Homepage") for effective data analysis and is led by PhD 
[Roger D. Peng](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~rpeng/ "Author's page"), Associate Professor of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (Department of Biostatistics).

As I do this unofficially (without enrolling), the minimum information is given. For the details, please contact the author or search for related sites on the web. Unfortunately, Coursera no more supports this course, focusing on the [newer one](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming "R Programming").
